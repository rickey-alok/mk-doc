### What is Git?

- an open source
  - so it is free to use and developers can modify the source code to suit their needs
- distributed version-control system, for software development mainly
  - meaning there is no central point of control
  - every computer is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version-tracking abilities
- but not a programming language
- developed by **Linus Torvalds** in 2005

### Why do we use Git?

- Collaboration
  - allows multiple developers to work on the same project at the same time without interfering with one another
- Branching
  - allows developers to create branches of a project, so they can make changes without affecting the main version of the project
- Speed
  - fast and efficient system which allows developers to work quickly and seamlessly on projects
- Security
  - uses encryption to secure data transfer and storage, which helps keep sensitive information safe

### Git and GitHub workflow

At first, I use to struggle to grasp the intricacies of Git and GitHub workflows via command lines. Despite encountering numerous resources available on the internet that discussed these activities, their explanations remained unclear. So, I decided to simplify the process. After using these commands extensively, I created a visual workflow that explains the purpose of each command and makes them easier to remember.

## Git Commands

Git offers a plethora of commands, but some are used only occasionally (One time commands) â€” when setting up our IDE and some are used Frequently as part of our daily work routine.

### One time commands

- **[git init]:** initialize an existing directory as a Git repository
- **[git config --global user.email "xyz@gmail.com"]**: set an email address that will be associated with each history marker
- **[git config --global user.name "yourName"]**: set a name that is identifiable for credit when review version history
- **[git remote add origin "url - http or SHH"]**: add a remote repository
- **[git clone "url - http or SHH"]**: retrieve an entire repository from a hosted location via URL
