# Welcome to Our API Hub: Simplifying Technical Information

![doc-image](https://rickey-alok.github.io/api-go-to-doc/img/home_page_img.png)

Our website aims to present all API-related information in a simple, easy-to-understand language. No more hassle ‚Äî just straightforward concepts consolidated to make our lives easier in this API learning journey. After all, everyone should know the basics of APIs and be able to comprehend them.

We often hear the term Docs-as-Code when we talk about API writing. This approach involves creating documentation using the same tools and processes that developers use for coding. It‚Äôs not just about writing rather it‚Äôs an agile mindset for documenting content effectively.

To align with this mindset, some of the tools/applications are listed, knowledge of which, will help you to get a better understanding of this API journey.

- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**: A versatile code editor that developers love
- **Git & GitHub**: Essential for version control and collaborative development
- **Jenkins**: An automation server for continuous integration and delivery
- **Postman**: Simplify API testing and collaboration.

One of the best things is that no need to spend a single penny to access these software tools as they are all open-source üòÅ.

# Sample API creation steps

We're going to create an api using NODE.js application. Node.JS runs on any operating system - such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer and so on. But for this project we will run in VS code editor, which also supports Node.JS.

## Prerequisites

<ol><li>Install Node.Js application. Refer to Download Node.JS
<ol type="a">
    <li>Make sure to select LTS (long Term Support), and not the CURRENT version. LTS considered the more stable version and not grequently updated, but for the Current version it is other way around.</li>
    <li>Select Windows installer if you have windows installer.</li>
    <li>Follow the screen text to get the application downloaded.</li>
    <li>Once the application is donwloaded, opem command prompt, and just type <em>node --version</em> or <em>node -v</em>. you'll be presented with the installed version, something like <em>v18.12.1</em> if the application is installed successfully.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Install VS code application.</li></ol>
